# Song-Lyric-Repetition-Analysis

For this project I calcualted the average ratio of unuqe words to total words in the Billboard top 60 songs for every year since 1960, and performed linear regression using a function built from scratch. I found a weak negative correlation from 1960-2010, and a weak positive correlation from 2010-2023.
